		<h2>Format Overview</h2>
			<p>A GIF is a bitmap image format. This format was usually used on websites to display animations. It can be used to store low color sprite data for games, also it could be used for low-resolution video clips or animations.” All you have to do is provide the individual bitmap images that make up the frames of your animation, to make a GIF.”( Wikipe
		<h2>Format History</h2>
		<p>It was created by a team led by Steve Willhite on June 15, 1987. The GIFs are still used by the world wide web because of its support and portability. GIFs replaced RLE format which was black and white only. The PCX and the Mac. PNG was around at the time but the GIF format was more efficient because of its LZW(Lempel–Ziv–Welch). There were 2 versions of GIF, the 1st on was GIF87a and the other one was G89a. </p>
		<h2>Compression</h2>
		<p>GIF uses lossless compression using the LZW to reduce the size of the file without affecting the visual quality.GFI images make up 54.7% of all images on the internet, this shows that GIF images are more popular than JPG and PNG. “The average image size of a GIF is 2.4 KB. On average GIF compresses a file by 4:1 - 10:1.” (Tech Musings)<p>
		<h2>Similar Formats and Advantages / Disadvantages </h2>
		 <p>My format is good for graphics and logos with solid areas of color. GIF is small in size, which  is an advantage over similar formats. They can also support transparent backgrounds, which will give a more professional look to a webpage. It can also show any though in a more clear way. 
GIFs are bad at limiting pattles (finite set of colors) which make this format less suitable for creating color pictures and other images with color gradients. “The maximum number of colors a GIF can use is 256, but simpler images usually need less than that.” (connectusfund). Editing is not possible and internet connections matter,some GIF pics depend on it. JPG is better for photographs it gives better quality images than the GIF. It also allows the users to choose the file size and the image quality. A PNG is not limited to 256 colors.<p>
